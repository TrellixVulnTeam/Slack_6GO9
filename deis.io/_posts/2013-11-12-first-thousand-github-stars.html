<p>Last week, the Deis project passed 1,000 GitHub stars. Looking through the <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis/stargazers">list of developers</a>, we are flattered and humbled.</p>
<p>Three months ago we launched Deis with the slogan "Your PaaS, Your Rules" because we thought software teams wanted an application platform they could customize â€” a platform that appeals to developers, but also to the engineers in charge of operating it. Your response has been overwhelming.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your support. We're just getting started.</p>
