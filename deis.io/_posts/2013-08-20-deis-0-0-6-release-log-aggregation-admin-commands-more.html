<p>The Deis project is proud to announce our 0.0.6 release which includes some important new features such as log aggregation and one-off admin commands and lots of bug fixes.</p>

<h2>What is Deis?</h2>
<p>Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis-cookbook">Chef cookbooks</a> that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application platform for public and private clouds. Your PaaS. Your Rules.</p>
<h2>0.0.6 Summary</h2>
<h4>New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>deis logs</code>: automatic aggregation of Docker container logs using rsyslog</li>
<li><code>deis run &lt;command&gt;</code>: run one-off commands inside ephemeral Docker containers</li>
<li><code>deis open</code>: open your application in your default browser</li>
<li>Documentation search now available at <a href="http://docs.deis.io/">http://docs.deis.io/</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<h3>Backwards Incompatible Changes</h3>
<p>There are a few backwards incompatible changes we need to get behind us. Firstly, we need to allow <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/120">multiple applications to be hosted on a single formation</a> with a single set of proxy and runtime nodes. This will allow Deis to meet the needs of software teams looking to host multiple dev/test applications using Docker. Secondly, we need to support <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/52">layers that serve as both proxy and runtime</a> to minimize node usage for small deployments and ultimately allow for cross-provider formations.</p>
<h3>Rackspace &amp; Digital Ocean Providers</h3>
<p>We've had many <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues/73">requests for a Digital Ocean provider</a>. We also need to build an OpenStack-based provider for Deis. That means Rackspace and Digital Ocean will be our next supported providers. We will be using a TDD approach to help formalize the process for implementing a new provider.</p>
<h3>Acceptance Test Automation</h3>
<p>Deis has many moving parts. In order to ensure quality from release to release we are building an end-to-end test framework based on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pexpect/">pexpect</a>. The test auomation will include creating formations, scaling layers, deploying applications, scaling containers and more. The automation test will be available in the repository for anyone to run.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Docker Integration</h3>
<p>Deis currently uses Docker as a LXC wrapper for running Buildpack slugs that are bind-mounted into <a href="https://github.com/opdemand/buildstep">Buildstep</a> images. As soon as the Docker Private Registry code stabilizes, we will be adding a new <code>git push</code> build process that creates and distributes images via <code>Dockerfile</code> and a private registry hosted on the controller. We will also allow builds to reference any existing Docker image by a fully qualified image URI.</p>
<h3>SSL Support</h3>
<p>Both the controller and formation proxies require SSL configuration. Right now controller sessions are just HTTP with cookies and passwords sent in the clear! Before we tackle formation SSL, we need the backwards incompatible changes to applications and proxies to land in master.</p>
<h3>General Security Improvements</h3>
<p>We've glossed over some pretty important security features in an effort to get Deis into developers hands sooner rather than later. For example, we need to implement iptables host-level firewalls, improve security group default rules, use Chef recipes to harden systems, etc. If you find any other security holes, please open a GitHub issue and tag it "Security".</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<h3>Team Support</h3>
<p>As of now, only a single user can control or push to a <a href="http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/terms/formation/">formation</a>. We need to add simple sharing features, which we can then expand upon using finer-grained access controls.</p>
<h3>Health Checks</h3>
<p>We do not currently monitor nodes or container health -- though we have infrastructure in place to do it.</p>
<h3>Service Discovery</h3>
<p>We need to make it as easy for ops folks to publish a set of reusable backing services (databases, queues, storage, etc) and allow developers to attach those services to applications. This will be done in a loosely coupled way, following Twelve Factor best practices.</p>
