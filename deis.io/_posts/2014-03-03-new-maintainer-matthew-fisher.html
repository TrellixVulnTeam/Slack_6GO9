<p>We are proud to welcome Matthew Fisher as a new maintainer. Formerly one of our largest external contributors, Matthew is now working on Deis full time!</p>
<p>Matthew has worked in and around PaaS since graduating from the British Columbia Institute of Technology. Most recently, Matthew worked on Stackato, ActiveState's Cloud Foundry platform. Pro-tip: If you're looking to merge code into Deis, Matthew loves cheese.</p>
