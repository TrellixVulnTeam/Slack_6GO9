To begin working with Helm, run the 'helm update' command:

$ helm update

This will download all of the necessary data. Common actions from this point
include:

- helm help COMMAND: see help for a specific command
- helm search: search for charts
- helm fetch: make a local working copy of a chart
- helm install: upload the chart to Kubernetes

For more information on Helm, go to http://helm.sh.

ENVIRONMENT:
$HELM_HOME:     Set an alternative location for Helm files. By default, these
				are stored in ~/.helm
