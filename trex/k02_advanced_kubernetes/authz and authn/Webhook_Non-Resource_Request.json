# Non-resource paths include: /api, /apis, /metrics, /resetMetrics, /logs, /debug, /healthz, /swagger-ui/, /swaggerapi/, /ui, and /version. Clients require access to /api, /api/*, /apis, /apis/*, and /version to discover what resources and versions are present on the server. Access to other non-resource paths can be disallowed without restricting access to the REST api.

# For further documentation refer to the authorization.v1beta1 API objects and plugin/pkg/auth/authorizer/webhook/webhook.go.
